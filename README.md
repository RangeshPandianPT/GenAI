# 🚀 GenAI – Learning Generative AI from Scratch

*A hands-on journey into LLMs, Tokenization, RAG pipelines, PDF vector processing, and API development.*

Welcome to my **Generative AI learning repository**!
This project documents my step-by-step progress in understanding the **core foundations of GenAI**, including tokenization, embeddings, vector stores, retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), and backend integration using FastAPI.

## 📌 **What This Repository Contains**

### 📁 **1. Tokenization & Vocabulary Building**

Includes Python scripts where I learned:

* How tokenizers work
* Creating custom vocab files
* Training BPE tokenizers
* Understanding merges, vocab length, and token distribution
  Files:
* `vocab_train.py`
* `vocab_path.py`
* `vocab_length.py`
* `my_bpe-merges.txt`
* `my_bpe-vocab.json`
* `words.txt`

### 📁 **2. RAG Model (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**

Hands-on implementation of:

* PDF text extraction
* Converting documents into embeddings
* Vector indexing and similarity search
* Building a simple RAG pipeline for answering queries
  Folder: **Rag Model**

---

### 📁 **3. API Development (FastAPI)**

I built API endpoints to:

* Generate responses
* Interact with the RAG pipeline
* Test HTTP GET & POST requests
* Understand API structure
  Folder: **API**

---

### 📁 **4. FastAPI Todo App**

A beginner-level FastAPI project to understand:

* CRUD operations
* Path & query parameters
* Async routes
  Folder: **fastapi-todo-main**
